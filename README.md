# My to do App

This solo project was realized during my Web Dev training @BeCode. It is part of the React learning.

## Mission

My mission was to build a small todo application that lives in the browser, and saves tasks even after restarting the browser.

## Skills, languages and features

- Creation of a project with Vite
- Handling basic hooks
- Saving the tasks in a local storage
- Extra features: "Clear list" button, "Night mode" toggle switch (in progress)
- Styling with SASS
- Responsiveness

## Deployment
